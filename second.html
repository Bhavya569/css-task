    <h1>
        Luka Dončić
    </h1>

    <p>
        Dončić was a youth player for Union Olimpija before joining the youth academy of Real Madrid. In 2015, he made
        his debut for the academy's senior team at age 16, becoming the youngest in club history. He made his senior
        debut for Slovenia in 2016 at only 17 years of age. He later helped his country win its first EuroBasket title,
        in 2017, while also being named to the All-Tournament Team. Dončić led Madrid to the 2018 EuroLeague title,
        winning the EuroLeague MVP and the Final Four MVP. He was named the ACB Most Valuable Player and won
        back-to-back EuroLeague Rising Star and ACB Best Young Player awards. Dončić was also selected to the EuroLeague
        2010–20 All-Decade Team.[3]

        In 2018, Dončić declared for the NBA draft, where he was drafted third overall by the Atlanta Hawks and then
        traded to the Dallas Mavericks.[note 1] Dončić was unanimously selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team and won
        Rookie of the Year for the 2018–19 season. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2023–24 season, becoming the
        first European to lead the NBA in scoring and second international player to achieve the feat. That season, he
        led the Mavericks to their third NBA Finals appearance. Dončić is also the Mavericks' franchise leader in career
        triple-doubles,[6] and holds the record for most points in a Mavericks season.[7]

        In September 2012, at 13 years of age, Dončić signed a five-year contract with Real Madrid, immediately standing
        out on the under-16 team with coach Paco Redondo.[18][27] Dončić moved to Madrid, living with football and
        basketball prospects.[10] In February 2013, he led Real Madrid to a Minicopa Endesa win, averaging 24.5 points,
        13 rebounds, four assists, and six steals per game. In the tournament's final game, Dončić had 25 points, 16
        rebounds, and five steals to defeat FC Barcelona and win MVP honors.[28] In March, he earned MVP accolades of
        the under-16 Spain Championship, scoring 25 points in a championship game win over the Gran Canaria youth
        team.[29]

        In the 2014–15 season, Dončić mainly played with Real Madrid's under-18 and reserve teams. He averaged 13.5
        points, 5.9 rebounds, and 3.1 assists with the reserve team, helping them win Group B of the Liga EBA, the
        amateur fourth-division of Spanish basketball.[30][31] By the end of the season, Dončić earned all-league
        honorable mention accolades from the basketball website Eurobasket.com.[30] In January 2015, Dončić won the
        under-18 Ciutat de L'Hospitalet Tournament and was selected to the All-Tournament Team, despite being two years
        younger than the rest of the team.[32] On January 6, against the youth team of his former club Union Olimpija,
        he posted a double-double of 13 points, 13 rebounds, four assists, and four steals.[33] In May 2015, Dončić won
        the under-18 Next Generation Tournament, for which he was selected MVP after helping defeat defending champions
        Crvena zvezda Belgrade in the final.[34]
